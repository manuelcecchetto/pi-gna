# Changelog

What changed in each pi-gna release, newest first. Add a line under Unreleased as you go; `pnpm release`
moves those lines under the new version, and they become its GitHub release notes (docs/DESIGN.md, Versioning).

## Unreleased

- Screenshots on new Kanban cards: paste, drop or pick them in the add-card box. They are saved with the card,
  shown in its dialog, and read by its chats.
- pi-gna checks GitHub for new releases and installs them: a row at the foot of the sidebar shows the release
  notes and an Update button, and pi-gna > Check for Updates… checks right away.
- The sidebar shows pi-gna's version next to the logo.
- Chats opened from the sidebar no longer flash the empty state while their history loads.
- Resolving a Kanban card runs its chat in a git worktree under `~/.pi-gna/worktrees`, on a branch of its own
  (`pigna/<card>-…`), and leaves your checkout alone; the chat commits there for you to merge.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-03

- First release: a macOS desktop app for the pi coding agent, with chats grouped by project, a transcript
  with tool activity and thinking, a composer with attachments, queued and steering messages, an integrated
  browser that the agent can drive and you can annotate, and `pi --pigna` to open it from a terminal.
